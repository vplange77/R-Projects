# Introduction

MCAS is a cumulative test taken by all high school students in the state of Massachusetts. It was established in 1993 under the Massachusetts Education Reform Act, which coerced all students who were enrolled in tested grades within any publicly funded school in Massachusetts, to partake in the test. The test is taken from grade 3 up until grade 12, and is deemed as the lowest level of test taking for any high school student to graduate. It is thus easier in comparison to other standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT. With a total of 280, the average student is to score above 240 whereas students with learning, physical or mental disabilities could score between 220 and 238. MCAS encompasses various subjects such as technology, engineering history amongst others, but Math is the only test taken each year from grade 3. This prompted us to dig deeper into this subject as there was more data available on math tests. Additionally, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Massachusetts ranks the highest in mathematical performance amongst high school students. (MassBudget, 2010). We obtained MCAS data from the Boston Public Schools website, which consists of variables such as funding for each district, school enrollment, and the location of the districts (rural or urban settings) amongst others. However, upon our analysis of the various variables in the data, we observed three main issues which are that MCAS passing rates and how funding varies across districts within Massachusetts. In addition, there seems to be a sign of educational inequality which might be affecting students’ performance. Generally, students that tend to be within rural districts, where living standards and income are low, have no motivation to be in school or partake in any standardized tests. There is no incentive to establish a brighter future due to their surroundings. It has also been rumored that educational funding tends to be allocated to urban areas to continue to facilitate development and enhance course programs within such schools. Thus, our goal for this project is to understand factors that affect students’ MCAS Math scores with the aim of aiding administrators to focus on improving factors that have an impact on MCAS Math scores. Through this, we hope to solve the problem of education inequalities in Massachusetts, and hopefully work towards achieving a 100% success rate in math tests for all districts in Massachusetts.
